🐍 Snake Game
This is a classic Snake game built in Python! Control the snake, eat the food, and watch the snake grow longer with each bite. But be careful – don’t let the snake collide with itself or the walls, or it’s game over!

🎮 Gameplay
Goal: Guide the snake to eat food that randomly appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer, making the game progressively harder.
Controls:
Arrow keys to move the snake (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️).
Avoid crashing into the walls or the snake’s own body.
🛠️ Features
Score Tracking: Keep track of your score based on how much food the snake eats.
Game Over Screen: Displays a “Game Over” message with the final score when the game ends.
Dynamic Snake Length: The snake grows longer with each piece of food eaten.
Simple UI: Built using the turtle or pygame library for clean and simple graphics.

💡 How It Works
The game initializes a snake and food in random positions.
The player uses the arrow keys to move the snake.
The game detects collisions with the food and the snake’s own body, increasing the score and length of the snake.
The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself, displaying the final score.
